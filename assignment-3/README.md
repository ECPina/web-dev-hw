## Main <head> and <body> elements
You should only have one <head> & <body> element within your code. The head is where the structor of your page will come from (for example, the color of the background, the type of text, etc.) where as the body is where all the content you wish to display on the actual page will go.

## Structural VS Semantic Markup
Structural markup is for the layout and format of your code, such as paragraphs and line breaks. Semantic markup, on the other hand, is more about giving your text a certain look. For example, you use semantic markup to **bold** and *italicizes* your text. Both are important when building a webpage.

## Work Cycle
It probably took me longer than it should have to throw this page together. I also got a little carried away with text. I still struggle to get links to work properly and most of the times it's silly little mistakes. I really just like to make things harder on myself.
