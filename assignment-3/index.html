  <h2> Making Tamales </h2>
  <p>Tamales were a big part of my life growing up. My mother would often make them for special occasions. It's a long process, often started a day or two before the big meal. Family and friends would gather around, working together to make large batches that could be saved for leftovers. Just the smell of them brings me back to my childhood. </p>

  <p>Tamales take a lot of work for something that seems so small and simple! They can be made by one person, but traditionally, it's made with friends and family. Grab some extra hands and let's get get started. </p>

  <h3> What exactly is a tamale? </h3>
  <p>Not familar with what a tamale is?

    <blockquote><i>It's a traditonal Mexican dish that is made with a corn dough mixture and that can be filled with a various of meats. </i></blockquote>

    They can even be made with beans and cheese or, for those with a sweet tooth, sweet tamales can be made with cinnamon, sugar, and pineapples. This is wrapped with either corn huskes or banana leaves and then steamed. </p>

  <p>Today, we'll be make sweet tamales, which are my personal favorite. They don't take as long and are easy to make! </p>


  <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 small package of dry corn husks</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Filling</b>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup sweetened cocount flakes*</li>
    <li>1 (20 oz) pineapple chunks, chopped*</li>
  </ul>

  <b>For the Masa</b>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), softened</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups masa harina, corn flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups concut cream*</li>
    <li>1/4 cup condense milk</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>*These items can be substituted! Iâ€™ve known many receipes that will add raisins or take out the coconut. It depends all on your taste! I also like to add some cinnamon to my masa, which is something you can do too!</i></p>

  <h3>Now to start cooking!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak the corn husks about and hour before in a warm water bath. At about 30 minutes, shift though the corn husks and remove excess silk threads and rinse. Soak for another 30 minutes in a clean, warm bath.</li>

    <li> In a skillet, dry toast coconut flakes over low heat about 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside. Chop the pineapple chunks and set aside.</li>

    <li>Warm the cocunt creme and condense milk in a saucepan over low heat and then set aside.</li>

    <li>Place butter in a mixer and cream. Add vanilla, masa,  baking powerder, salt, and warm cocunt cream and condensed milk. Mix well.</li>

    <li>Take your now soft husks and place the wide end of the husk in the palm of your hand. Starting at the middle of husks, spread 2 tablespoons of the massa with the back of a spoon. Do not spread the masa to the ends.</li>

    <li>Spoon in about 1 tablespoon of filling down the center of the masa. Fold over the ends of the husk until they meet and roll. You can then either tie off each end with a thin strip of cornhusk, or you can fold the tail end of the corn husk and then tie off with a thing stip of cornhusk.</li>

    <li>Using a deep pot, you'll need a rack to put the tamales on. Place the rack and in the pot and pour water into the pot. Do not fill water all the way to the rack. Stack tamales until the pot is filled. Cover pot with a tightly fitting lid. Then set the heat on high and bring the water to a boil for about 15 minutes. Then lower the heat and simmer for 45 mintues to one hour. Try to keep an eye on your water. You'll know the tamale is done when it no longer sticks to the cornhusks.
