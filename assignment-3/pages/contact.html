  <h2> Making Tamales </h2>
  <p>Tamales were a big part of my life growing up. My mother would often make them for special occasions. It's a long process, often started a day or two before the big meal. Family and friends would gather around, working together to make large batches that could be saved for leftovers. Just the smell of them brings me back to my childhood. </p>

  <p>Tamales take a lot of work for something that seems so small and simple! They can be made by one person, but traditionally, it's made with friends and family. Grab some extra hands and let's get get started. </p>

  <h3> What exactly is a tamale? </h3>
  <p>Not familar with what a tamale is? It's a traditonal Mexican dish that is made with a corn dough mixture and that can be filled with a various of meats. They can even be made with beans and cheese or, for those with a sweet tooth, sweet tamales can be made with cinnamon, sugar, and pineapples. This is wrapped with either corn huskes or banana leaves and then steamed. </p>

  <p>Today, we'll be make sweet tamales, which are my personal favorite. They don't take as long and are easy to make! </p>
