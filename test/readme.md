#### Why Am I taking this class?
Back in 2012-2013, I took a class similar to this and had a lot of fun learning to make websites. I needed to fill some electives, but I also thought a refresher would be good for me. Now, the class at my old college used dreamweaver, so I’m definitely starting fresh with this class. We also primarily worked with CSS and HTML so I’m excited to try and learn something new. It’s feels pretty easy so far and I’m remember bits and pieces from my old class that’s helping.

 #### What exactly is the internet?

*Things I was interested in:*
- ARPANET
- VSAUCE telling me the difference between The Web and The Internet (Love this guy)

*Things I learned:*
- First message sent was: LO
- The World Wide Web when it first began and what it looked like
