<p><b>[Verse 1]</b><br />
Jumped down the well<br />
Found just your shell<br />
You’ll find yourself<br />
I’ll fix myself</p>

<p><b>[Verse 2]</b><br />
But if your sentences are short<br />
Oh, you’ll have to clear your throat<br />
Let the devil through the door<br />
Call yourself a young adult<br />
Seems like all the ones you lost<br />
Were the ones you asked to stay<br />
Best to pick apart your thoughts<br />
Before they do to you the same</p>

<p><b>[Bridge]</b><br />
Walk past the truth<br />
Don’t look for clues<br />
Trust only blue<br />
Trust only blue</p><br />

<p><b>[Verse 3]</b><br />
Though it’s not pleasant to feel<br />
It’s the only thing that’s real<br />
Any comfort you can get<br />
Is one that you won’t regret<br />
As the sunlight turns to dust<br />
I’ll try to resist the rust<br />
The only knife that doesn’t hurt<br />
Is the knife that you don’t touch</p>

<p><b>[Chorus]</b><br />
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot<br />
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft<br />
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off</p>

<p><b>[Pre-Chorus]</b><br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few<br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few <br />
<i>(Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)</i><br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few <br />
<i>(Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)</i><br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few <br />
<i>(Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)</i><br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few <br />
<i>(Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)</i></p>

<p><b>[Chorus]</b><br />
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot<br />
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft<br />
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off<br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few<br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few</p>

<p><b>[Instrumental]</b></p>

<p><b>[Chorus]</b><br />
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot<br />
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft<br />
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off<br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few<br />
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few</p>
