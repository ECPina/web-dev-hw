    <p><h1>>About Me</h1>
    Hello! My name is Erica Charmine Pina and I'm a student at the Univeristy of Montana! I'm currently working on my BFA in the Media Arts program. My current hobbies are drawing silly characters, writting sad stories, and occasionally playing video games <s>(is it time to play Dream Daddies yet?)</s>. As of right now, my goals are pretty broad, but I would really love to be apart of a company like Laika one day.</p>

    <p><h1>But why something EMO?</h1>
      You must be wondering: "But why would you draw this?" Growing up, emo was the very hot trend. Everyone had raccoon eyes and work Tripp NYC&reg; pants. And while at the time these kids were often seen as outcast, I found myself fitting right in with them. I never got to own my own pair of Tripp NYC&reg;, <i><b>BUT</b></i> I did have a jacket.
    </br>
      But it was more than the clothes and boys in guyliner. It was the music I was really drawn to. This is were I found my love for everything punk, rock, post-hardcore, techno related. I spoke to me on a level that I had never really expierenced before. So I spent hours listening to Senses Fail and doodling sad emo girls and writing even sadder stories (but don't worry; I grew up to be mostly funtional).
    </br>
      <b>TL;DR</b>
      Theres a sense of nostoliga there for me. I really enjoyed the culture, even if it was a bit silly. I thought it would be a fun way to express a part of myself.
