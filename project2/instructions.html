        <h2>Gathering References!</h2>
        <p>When building an alt character, it's good to gather some references to draw from. You can make your own or find other sources. I chose a more "Emo" character, which was a popular fashion style and music scene when I was in highschool. So I would be looking for things like:
          <ul>
            <li>Pixie hairstyles</li>
            <li>Tattoos</li>
            <li>Piercings</li>
            <li>Dark, torn clothes</li>
          </ul>
      <p>The idea is that an alternative character defies societal "norm." While the norms of society have somewhat changed today, I chose to go back in time and create a character from the early 2000s. I usually hit google or tumblr up for ideas. Here are some pictures I found to inspire my look:</p>

      <div id="step-two" class="container">
        <h1>Step two:</h1>
        <h2>Drawing your character!</h2>
        <p>Now it's time to draw your character! I always start with a rough sketch:</p>
        <img src="../project2/images/1roughsketch.jpg" />
        <p>Notice how I've hit the key points with the rough sketch; a messy pixie cut to show that he <i>"spends hours in front of the mirror, making his hair elegantly disheveled" (Admit it! by Say Anything),</i> has multiple piercings, and a sick bleeding rose tattoo. These small details give him an "edge."<p>
        <p>Next, I do a little bit of ink to help push some of the details/darks:<p>
        <img src="../project2/images/2ink.jpg" />
        <p>After that, I lay down a skin tone. I chose to make my character very pale, but don't be afraid of getting creative! Heck, maybe even give them an unnatural skintone like green or blue!
        <img src="../project2/images/3skintone.jpg" />
        <p>Next, I gave him some two toned eyes. Because every alt character is cooler with two colored eyes.</p>
