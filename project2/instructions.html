          <h2>Gathering References!</h2>
          <p>When building an alt character, it's good to gather some references to draw from. You can make your own or find other sources. I chose a more "Emo" character, which was a popular fashion style and music scene when I was in highschool. So I would be looking for things like:
            <ul>
              <li>Pixie hairstyles</li>
              <li>Tattoos</li>
              <li>Piercings</li>
              <li>Dark, torn clothes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I often browse <a href="http://www.google.com/">Goolge</a>, <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, or <a href="http://www.pintrest.com/">Pintrest</a> for some quick ideas. I also like to walk around and see whats in the world around me. The best refrences come from your own expierences.</p>

        <div id="step2" class="container">
          <h1>STEP TWO:</h1>
          <h2>Drawing your character!</h2>
          <p>Now it's time to draw your character! I always start with a rough sketch, which I've done in a red prisma color penicl:</p>
          <img src="../project2/images/1roughsketch.jpg" />
          <p>Notice how I've hit the key points with the rough sketch; a messy pixie cut to show that he <i>"spends hours in front of the mirror, making his hair elegantly disheveled" (Admit it! by Say Anything),</i> has multiple piercings, and a sick bleeding rose tattoo. These small details give him an "edge."<p>
          <p>Next, I do a little bit of ink to help push some of the details/darks:<p>
          <img src="../project2/images/2ink.jpg" />
          <p>After that, I lay down a skin tone. I'm working with Copic markers, which are alcohol based markers. These are my favorite and when paired with colored pencil because they cause the colored pencil to smear and bleed which can be cool.</p>
          <img src="../project2/images/3skintone.jpg" />
          <p>Next, I gave him some two toned eyes. Because every alt character is cooler with two colored eyes.</p>
          <img src="../project2/images/4eyes.jpg" />
          <p>Now a little hair color and finishing off the tattoo...</p>
          <img src="../project2/images/5hair-tatt.jpg" />
          <p>And once we've got that all done, we finish off the clothes!</p>
          <img src="../project2/images/6final.jpg" />
          <p>I chose to do and edgy band shirt (fictional, of course) as well as ripped jeans. I've also applied some bandaids for that <i>"cute but tough"</i> look. These little details will really tell alot about your character. Think about their personality, who they are as a person.</p>

        <div id="step3" class="container">
          <h1>STEP THREE:</H1>
          <h2>Giving your character a name!</h2>
          <p>Now it's time to name our character. I often stuggle with naming a character so I often head to the web to find some cool names! A lot of people like to look at the meaning of names, something that matches their personality. Or they like to keep it simple.</p>
          <p>I really like bibical names and unisex names. I also really like boys who have names that are considered more "feminine" and girls with names that are more "masucline." I think it can bring a fun element to your character. But I'm going for a cooler name. A name that sounds like something a really BA character would be called.</p>
          <p>I've decided to go with the name:</p>
          <img src="../project2/images/maddox.gif" />
          <p>I chose this name because he could be nicked named "Mad" or "Dox" which boy sound like very alternative, BA names to me.</p>

        <div id="step4" class="container">
          <h1>STEP FOUR:</h1>
          <h2>Give your character a back story!</h2>
          <p>Now that we've drawn a character and given him a name, what's he like? What's his backstory? When trying to create an intersting history of a character, I like to ask myself:
            <ol>
              <li>What kind of story am I writing?</li>
              <li>What are the themes I'm wanting to explore in that story?</li>
              <li>What kind of character do I want to write?</li>
            </ol>
          <p>There's many approaches you can take. For me, I often start with what kind of story do I want to write? This can be as simple as the genre, such as: horror, fantasy, sci, romance, etc,</i> to something more indepth, like a horror romance about a werewolf detective that keeps finding love in all the wrong places.</p>
          <p>I then move on to the themes I'm looking to explore; gender, sexuality, spiritualism, racism, and/or other soical issues or commentary.<p>
          <p>Next, what kind of person am I looking to create? Think spefically personaltiy traits. Are they grumpy? Quiet? Funny? Smart? Afraid of everything? A fun away to get some good ideas is to look at astrological charts or blood type persoanlities.</p>
          <p>For example, Let's take Maddox here. Let's say he's:
            <ul>
              <li>Stubborn</li>
              <li>Quiet</li>
              <li>Creative</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What could make Maddox have these traits? It's possible he's stubborn because that's how is father raised him. Maybe he's quiet because he's shy. And maybe he was encouraged to be creative because his mother was an artist. Notice how we already have a little history happening? The most imporant thing is to have fun and to think outside of the box. Write from your expierences to help make your characters feel dynamic.</p>
