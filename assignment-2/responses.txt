**1.) Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet.**
In order for information to travel across the internet, it is broken up into what we call "packets." Each of these packets can contain up to a max of 1,500 bytes. These bytes are wrapped in a header and footer, which act as an information pass that tells computers about the infromation inside the packet.

**2.) What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?**
An IP address, aka an *Internet Protocol address*, is a numerical label that is assigned to each device that is conneted to a computer network. This number acts as a host as well as a location address. The DNS, aka the Domain Name System, is what converts domain names to IP addresses. For example, everytime a domain name is typed into a browser, like Google.com for instance, it's automatically gets passed through to a DNS server. This server then translates the name to to it's corresponding IP address.

**3.) What is a cookie?**
While also a declious baked snack, *cookies* is a message that is used to identify users that is then given to the web browers by the web server.

There are different types of cookies that hold information for a different amout of time.
