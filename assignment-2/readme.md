**Version Control System**

Version control is a system that keeps track of changes that have been made to a file or set of files over time. This allows the user to recall specific versions later on if needed. For example, if an issue were to arise during the web building process, a VCS would allow me to go back and either recover lost information or allow me to start back from the pevious save point (similar to a save point in a video game).

*In Summary...*
I didn't expierence many issues this round. I found it was pretty straight forward. I think the only thing I struggled with was if I moved things around, I sometimes forgot to relink them. So then I had to refind the file and relink to my ATOM or GitHub. But so far, I'm finding that ATOM is pretty easy to work with and it's pretty easy to problem solve.
